# BigQueryScript
<h2> A dynamic SQL script that generates the best performing ad sets in Facebook Ads from the last 2 weeks, as well as those ad sets three top performing 
  ads</h2>
  
 <h3> To see how to make a FB ads pipeline into BigQuery, see Facebook_to_GCP repository</h3>
 
 <p> If anyone knows how to make an EXECUTE IMMEDIATE BigQuery function that can span across multiple lines please let me know! That is certainly
  the worst part about this script and it makes this query very difficult to edit.  So far I have tried: triple quotes and also concat() as in: 
  concat('part of q','part of q', 'part of q') and both do not run.  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE does not give error messages, only that there has been an error,
  so if you have any idea, don't be afraid to reach out!</p>
